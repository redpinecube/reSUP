## RESUP
This project investigates the enhancement of image resolution through image interpolation techniques to improve the performance of machine learning (ML) models. By exploring different use cases—such as medical imaging and satellite imagery—we aim to identify how resolution improvements can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions. Specific optimizations will be tailored for each domain.
